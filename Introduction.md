## Introduction/Business Problem 

These two cities: **Pittsburgh, PA** and **Cleveland, OH**, are known rivalry cities due to their football teams. 

They are only 2 hours driving distance away from each other and are similar in population 
(Pittsburgh: 305,012; Cleveland: 388,812). However, their restaurant landscapes are different, even for those 
fast-food restaurant chains. 

**In this study, I am interested in categorizing neighborhoods in Pittsburgh and Cleveland
using census data and venue data from Foursquare.com to make recommendations to fast-food restaurant chain stores
when they want to open new locations in another city.**

For example. I am using data of four fast-food restaurant chains: 

**Shake Shack, BIBIBOP Asian Grill, Potbelly Sandwich Shop, and Krispy Krunchy Chicken**, 

for which they only exist in Cleveland and other city, as examples to generated recommended neighborhoods 
in Pittsburgh to open new stores. This methodology can also be applied to any other cities or making 
recommendations to other types of business.
